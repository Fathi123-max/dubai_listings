## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Email our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any potential impact
   - Your name/handle for recognition in our security acknowledgments (optional)

We will respond to your report within 48 hours with our assessment and next steps.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patches to the latest minor version. We recommend always running the latest patch version of the project.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. Always keep your dependencies up to date
2. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
3. Enable 2FA for all services
4. Never commit sensitive information to version control
5. Use environment variables for configuration

### For Developers

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Validate and sanitize all user input
3. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. Implement proper authentication and authorization
5. Keep dependencies up to date
6. Use security headers (already configured in the project)
7. Implement rate limiting (already configured in the project)
8. Use HTTPS for all connections
9. Implement proper CORS policies
10. Log security-relevant events

## Dependency Security

We use the following tools to monitor and update dependencies:

- `npm audit` for vulnerability scanning
- Dependabot for automated dependency updates
- Snyk for additional security scanning

## Security Headers

This project includes the following security headers by default:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()

## Rate Limiting

API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse. The default limits are:

- 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP for the auth endpoints
- 1000 requests per hour per IP for other endpoints

## Data Protection

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- API keys and other secrets are never logged
- Sensitive data is never included in error messages

## Security Audits

Regular security audits are performed to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. The results of these audits are reviewed by the security team and appropriate actions are taken.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure guidelines. Security researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices will be acknowledged for their contributions to improving our security.

## Security Training

All team members receive security training and are required to follow secure coding practices.

## Incident Response

In the event of a security incident, we will:

1. Acknowledge the incident
2. Investigate the root cause
3. Fix the vulnerability
4. Notify affected users if necessary
5. Release a security update
6. Document the incident and lessons learned

## Contact

For any security-related questions or concerns, please contact [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).
